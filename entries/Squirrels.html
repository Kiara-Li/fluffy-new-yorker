        <div class="wide"><span>Squirrels don’t need alarm clocks. They wake up at dawn, as if they’re off to a breakfast buffet of acorns. Who needs coffee? 🐿️🌰</span></div>
        <div><span><img src="../images/entriesimg/squirrel/IMG_1696.PNG" alt="Image 1"></span></div>
        <div class="tall"><span>Owls don’t mess around. The nighttime predator swoops down silently, but squirrels have perfected the art of playing “hide and squeak” under moonlight. 🦉🐿️</span></div>

        <div><span>Squirrels can’t stop hoarding. They spend most of their waking hours hiding food, probably because they don’t want to run out of snacks during their naps! 🐿️🥜</span></div>

        <div class="wide"><span>Hawks are squirrel’s aerial enemies. When a squirrel hears the call of a hawk, it turns into a furry speedster, with a dash of “whoops, not today!” 🦅🐿️</span></div>
